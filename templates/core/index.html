<p>
  This is a hugging enablement platform. Hugging as a Service, if you will.
  People need hugs, that's a fact of life, but there are times when friends and
  family aren't available to provide them. This is where mbrace comes in. You
  need a hug, hopefully someone nearby needs one or is willing to provide one.
</p>

<p>
  Log in, send a hug request, someone reaches out to you. You meet up, hug it
  out, maybe have a quick chat about what's going on in your lives. When you're
  done, you give your hug buddy a rating and a review, to provide future patrons
  an idea of what they're in for.
