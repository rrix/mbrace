mbrace
======

This is a hugging enablement platform. Hugging as a Service, if you will.
People need hugs, that's a fact of life, but there are times when friends and
family aren't available to provide them. This is where mbrace comes in. You
need a hug, hopefully someone nearby needs one or is willing to provide one.

Log in, send a hug request, someone reaches out to you. You meet up, hug it
out, maybe have a quick chat about what's going on in your lives. When you're
done, you give your hug buddy a rating and a review, to provide future patrons
an idea of what they're in for.

This is not a dating platform.

This is not a hookup platform.

This is about giving people some love when they need it.
